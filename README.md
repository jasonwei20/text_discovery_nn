# text_discovery_nn

This project uses word embeddings and neural networks to discover potentially significant segments of text in historical narratives. The dataset I used for this is the book [Side by Side](https://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1532494633&sr=8-1&keywords=side+by+side+sami+adwan) by Sami Adwan, which tells the history of the Israeli Palesnian conflict from both Israeli and Palestinian viewpoints.
